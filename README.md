# ✨ Project Title:
Smart-Parking-Gate-System
# Objectives:
 • Design a simple parking gate control system using Arduino.
 • Allow the user to open and close the gate with a single push button.
 • Provide clear visual indicators through an LCD display (GO / WAIT / STOP).
 • Use an RGB LED to indicate the gate status (Green for GO – Orange for WAIT – Red for STOP).
 • Practice integrating electronic components (Button, LCD, RGB LED, Servo) with Arduino programming.

 # Hypothesis:
 If the button is pressed the first time, the gate will open, the green light will turn on, and the screen will display “GO”.
When the button is pressed again, the screen will display “WAIT” with a countdown (3–1), the orange light will turn on, and then the gate will close, the screen will display “STOP”, and the red light will turn on.

# Background:
 • Modern parking lots often use automated systems to control entry and exit gates.
 • This project simulates a simplified version of such systems using Arduino and basic electronic components.
 • It is a useful educational application to understand microcontroller programming and integration with sensors and actuators.

 # Hardware Stack:
 • Arduino UNO
 • Push Button
 • Servo Motor (for gate control)
 • LCD 16x2 Display
 • RGB LED (Red, Green, Orange)
 • Resistors, Jumper wires, Breadboard
